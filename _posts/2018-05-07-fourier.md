## Important People

The Fourier Transform has gotten to be one of the most interesting parts of math that I've seen. Granted, that I'm not a super wise guy and there are so many more maths that are so much cooler, but I'd say that that is what really got me started on the path that I am in today, and I'd say that the two people who most influenced me to understanding it were [H. Steven Colburn](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/h-steven-colburn-ph-d/) and [Andy Fan](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/andy-fan-ph-d/)

And, of course, my peers who helped me understand it more and more for months: Nathan Nard, Sara Gravelyn, and Sandesh Gourkar. The books that I most used were [Oppenheim, Willsky and Nawab's Signals and Systems [2E]](https://www.amazon.com/Signals-Systems-2nd-Alan-Oppenheim/dp/0138147574/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1526736890&sr=8-3&keywords=oppenheim&dpID=517NQ2TVYQL&preST=_SX258_BO1,204,203,200_QL70_&dpSrc=srch), and [Oppenheim and Schafer's Discrete-Time Signal Processing [3E]](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Time-Signal-Processing-3rd-Prentice-Hall/dp/0131988425/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1526736890&sr=8-4&keywords=oppenheim&dpID=51v48p99JjL&preST=_SX258_BO1,204,203,200_QL70_&dpSrc=srch). They are classics, in which I feel like every engineer should have a copy on their bookshelf. I totally learned a lot reading them!

## Background
So there's a lot of good information online about the [Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform). The two equations in which **engineers** may see a lot are, for the continuous-time Fourier Transform, are  
$$ X(j\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-j\omega t} dt \quad \text{(Analysis Equation)}$$   
$$ x(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} X(j\omega) e^{j\omega t} d\omega \quad \text{(Synthesis Equation)} $$


**Mathematicians** and **physicists** in the other hand may see the following equations:  
$$ X(j\omega) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-j\omega t} dt \quad \text{(Analysis Equation)}$$   
$$ x(t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} X(j\omega) e^{j\omega t} d\omega \quad \text{(Synthesis Equation)} $$

That is just different conventions, in which should both be appreciated.

If you are interested in reading Fourier's paper, you can get [original from 1822]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/fourier/Fourier[1822]Theorie_de_La_Chaleur.pdf) or the [translated]({{ site.url }}/assets/images/fourier/Fourier[1878]_The_Analytical_Theory_of_Heat_Translated_by_Alexander_Freeman.pdf) version, translated by Alexander Freeman.

Fourier originally made it because he wanted to study heat, and it's quite interesting since I think it was still considered to be a theory then (unless I misinterpret, since theory may have different connotations, such as Music Theory).

## Different Types of Fourier Transform

There are different types of Fourier Transforms for different case scenarios.  

| Type                                   | Input                                  | Output                                           | Equations                                            |  
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| Continuous-Time Fourier Transform      | $$x(t) \rightarrow \text{Continuous}$$ | $$X(j\omega) \rightarrow \text{Continuous}$$     |  $$X(j\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-j\omega t} dt$$ <br> $$x(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} X(j\omega) e^{j\omega t} d\omega$$ |
| Discrete-Time Fourier Transform        | $$x[n] \rightarrow \text{Discrete}$$   | $$X(e^{j\omega}) \rightarrow \text{Continuous}$$ | $$X(e^{j\omega}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] e^{-j\omega n} dt$$ <br> $$x[n] = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{2\pi} X(e^{j\omega}) e^{j\omega n} d\omega$$ |
| Discrete Fourier Transform             | $$x[n] \rightarrow \text{Discrete}$$   | $$X[k] \rightarrow \text{Discrete}$$             | $$X[n_0,\omega) = DTFT_{m\rightarrow \omega} \{ w[m] x[n_0 + m] \}$$ <br> $$X[n,\omega_0) = x[n] * w[-n] e^{j\omega_0 n}$$ |
| Time-Dependent Fourier Transform       | $$x[n] \rightarrow \text{Discrete}$$   | $$X[n,\omega)$$                                  | $$X(j\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-j\omega t} dt$$ <br> $$x(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} X(j\omega) e^{j\omega t} dt$$ |
