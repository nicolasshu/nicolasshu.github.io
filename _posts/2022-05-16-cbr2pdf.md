# Convert CBR to PDF

Either go to the original [repo](https://github.com/julian-heng/cbr2pdf) or get it from the AUR

```
yay -S cbr2pdf-git
```

To use it, run
```
cbr2pdf -i /path/to/all/cbr/files/ -o /path/to/output/directory
```

# Rescale the PDFs to Letter or A4

Go to [tavinus/pdfScale](https://github.com/tavinus/pdfScale), and get the `pdfScale.sh` file. Then, use the following flags (suggested):
- `-r` to resize. E.g.: `-r letter`
- `-s` to scale. E.g.: `-s 0.9`

And run this through every file: 

```bash
# resize_all_pdfs.sh
for f in ./*.pdf
do
  ./pdfScale.sh -v -r letter -s 0.9 "$f"
done
```

This should resize all of the pdfs so that they can be printed on a standard US printer. By default, it will rotate the pages appropriately.

# Merge all PDFs

```bash
yay -S pdftk
```

Catenate the PDFs together
```
pdftk *.pdf cat output full_collection.pdf
```
