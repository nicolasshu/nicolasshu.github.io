The prefix key is `C-b` (`Ctrl+b`). Here we'll use `arrow` to represent any of the arrow keys (`left`,`right`,`up`,`down`)

# Shortcuts
## Panes
`"` - Splits plane vertically
`%` - Splits plane horizontally
`arrow` - Navigate between panes
`Ctrl`+`arrow` - Resize current pane
`q` - Show the pane numbers

## Windows
`c` - Create new window
`,` - Rename window
`p` - Move to previous window
`n` - Move to next window


## Sessions
`(` - Move to previous session
`)` - Move to next session
`d` - Detach from session
`b` - Rename session


# Scripting
If you wish to create multiple panes and launch different things from the command line, you can create a script. 

In order to initiate a new session and detach from it from the session

```bash
tmux new-session -d
```

Then you can split the window into two panes with `tmux split-window`. Here, you can split the window either vertically with the `-v` flag, or horizontally, with the `-h` flag. If none are specified, then `-v` is assumed.

```bash
tmux split-window -v
```

Next you can send commands to the new pane with `tmux send`. Here, simply send a string followed by `ENTER` to send the command

```bash
tmux send 'ls' ENTER
```

If you wish to switch panes, you first need to determine the number. Commonly, using `Ctrl`+`b` +`q` will quickly show you the pane numbers. Then by using `tmux select-pane`, you can choose the pane to move to. 

```bash
tmux select-pane -t 0
```

Finally, if you wish to view the session, you can use `tmux attach-session`. A full working example is shown below:

```bash
# launch.sh
tmux new-session -d
tmux split-window -v
tmux send 'conda activate myenv' ENTER
tmux send 'python' ENTER
tmux send 'x=1' ENTER
tmux send 'print(x)' ENTER
tmux split-window -v
tmux selected-pane -t 0
tmux send 'node' ENTER
tmux attach-session
```
