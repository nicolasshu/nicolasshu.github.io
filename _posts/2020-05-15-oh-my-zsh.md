This is a guide to install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)


## Install Prereqs: Zsh & Git
First we need to install Zsh. This will be the basis of Oh-My-Zsh. 
```bash
sudo apt install zsh
```

Next, we need to install git

```bash
sudo apt install git
```


Now we need to get the installation script and then install it
```bash
$ wget https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh
$ bash ./install.sh
```

In the installation, it will ask if you wish to change your default shell to zsh. Say yes, enter your username password, and you'll receive a screen like the one below. If you miss it, run the command below, followed by logging out and back in to make the change [Source](https://askubuntu.com/questions/131823/how-to-make-zsh-the-default-shell)

```
$ chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

Now you can start editing your `~/.zshrc` file. 

## Customize Oh-My-Zsh

### Choosing a theme. 

There are [multiple themes](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes) that you can use. I like `agnoster` and `powerlevel9k`. In order to change the theme, in your `~/.zshrc`, you need to change the `ZSH_THEME` variable

```
ZSH_THEME="agnoster"
```

But if you simply source it, you will get some errors

### Fixing the Fonts
In order to fix those issues, you need to 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git
$ cd fonts
$ ./install.sh
```

Next go to your terminal's Preferences and change it to the Font: `Meslo LG S DZ for Powerline Regular` or whichever Powerline font you prefer. 

### Plugins 

This will automatically come with the `git` plugin, which is defined in your `~/.zshrc` file

```
plugins=(git)
```

## Using Powerlevel9K Shell

### Install the PowerLevel9K Shell

In order to have install the Powerlevel9K theme, you need to clone it into your themes folder 

```
git clone https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel9k
```

Set your theme to `ZSH_THEME="powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k` in your `~/.zshrc` file, and source it.

### Install Nerd Fonts
There are many fonts that you can use with PowerLevel9K. [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) have a lot of icons that can be use. [Hack](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/Hack)

You can follow their instructions to install their fonts, and add the following in the `~/.zshrc` file 

```
POWERLEVEL9K_MODEL="nerdfont-complete"
```


### Customize the PowerLevel9K Prompt

There are a lot of different customizations that you may use  

https://github.com/Powerlevel9k/powerlevel9k/wiki/stylizing-your-prompt

This is one setting that I like. 


```
POWERLEVEL9K_LEFT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS=(os_icon virtualenv anaconda context dir vcs status)
```

In the end, you'll get something like this

### Other Separators
You can also use different separators

### Additional
If you are using Snap packages, because you are now using `zsh`, they won't get recognized as applications for your environment. In order to be able to recognize or to allow them to be added, e.g. to your Latte Dock (if using KDE), as per [hackel's suggestion](https://askubuntu.com/a/989485/754346), you need to add the following line to your `/etc/zsh/zprofile`

```bash
emulate sh -c 'source /etc/profile'
```

Now, just log out and log back in, and you'll see the changes.
