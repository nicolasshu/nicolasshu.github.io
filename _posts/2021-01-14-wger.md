So hard. Okay. Several things. This is if you wish to run it not via Docker. As of today (2021-01-14), their docker images were not working very well for single board computers or for servers. So it had to go via the local.

## Install wger

Go to [wger's website](https://github.com/wger-project/wger), and follow their instructions for installing wger. As of today (2021-01-14), their instructions for running it as a Django app are the following:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-dev nodejs npm git
sudo npm install -g yarn sass
python3 -m venv wger
source wger/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/wger-project/wger.git
cd wger
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py develop
wger create-settings
wger bootstrap
wger load-online-fixtures
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Then login as `admin` and password is `adminadmin`. This will be launched on its port 8000. But because they are set on `http://localhost:8000`, you can't reach it from another computer. So let's expose some ports...

## Open the Ports 

Follow this guy's explanation on (https://www.journaldev.com/34113/opening-a-port-on-linux)

Now, we're going to forward the 8000 port to 8001, and expose 8001. Basically, you need to open the firewall port via 

```bash
sudo ufw allow 8001
```

Note: You might need to use if you use `firewalld` systems (e.g. CentOS)

```
firewall-cmd --add-port=8001/tcp --permanent
```

On your single board comptuer, you can install a GUI to check the firewall (`ufw`) with 

```bash
sudo apt install gufw
```

## Forward Ports

Omg. I need to make another post about this some other time. This is such a useful tool. The [`iisexpress-proxy`](https://github.com/icflorescu/iisexpress-proxy) allows you to forward ports from `XXXX` to `YYYY` wish such ease. Install it with:

```bash
npm install -g iisexpress-proxy
```

Then simply run

```
iisexpress-proxy 8000 to 8001
```

And now your port http://localhost.8000 can be seen at http://192.168.1.X:8001



## Starting the Server's `wger`

I haven't thought out much about how to launch it yet. I haven't gotten `screen -d -m <command>` to work properly. So as of now, do the following:

### 1) SSH into the Board
```
ssh username@192.168.1.X
```

### 2) Run the App
Create a screen and run the app

```bash
screen -S wger
```

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source ~/envs/wger/bin/activate
```

Run the app and detach
```bash
python manage.py runserver
# Ctrl + A + D
```

### 3) Forward the Port

Create a screen to forward the port
```bash
screen -S portforward
```

Forward the port and detach
```bash
iisexpress-proxy 8000 to 8001
# Ctrl + A + D
```

Now you can access it at the board's IP and port 8001: http://192.168.1.X:8001
